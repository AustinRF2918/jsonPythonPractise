->Central Attribute Database:
    ->First thing we need to have is every single attribute an object needs to have. This is because
    we need to give the user a set of terms that will facilitate searching. So, based on the bootstrap
    themes, I have come up with the following.
        ->Single Page
        ->Multi Page
        ->Dynamic Friendly
        ->Business
        ->Personal
        ->Casual
        ->Dark
        ->Light
        ->Beautiful
        ->Drab
        ->Full
        ->Component
        ->ECommerce
        ->Technical
            ->I will be implementing these as JSON. SQL is a little bit overkill for this, as much
            as I wanna start using this.

->Template Database:
    ->Name will appear in array portion one (Pseudo primary key), and we will have multiple attributes:
        PageStyle : [Single Page, Multi Page]
        Dynamicity : [Dynamic Friendly, Nondynamic]
        Casuality : [Personal, Casual, Business]
        Lightness : [Light, Dark]
        Beautiful : [Yes, No]
        ECommerce : [Yes, No]
        Techincal : [Yes, No]
        Component : [Yes, No]
        Full : [Yes, No]

Place this in a template folder directory for easy parsing, folder name will be our primary key.
